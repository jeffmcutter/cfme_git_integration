# cfme_git_integration
Allow syncronization of cfme bits from remote appliance to here over ssh using cfme-rhconsulting-scripts.  Good for using with git.

Depends on https://github.com/rhtconsulting/cfme-rhconsulting-scripts being installed.
Recommend use of SSH keys or other way of caching password.
